[METADATA] Category of Proposal
Answer:**

Dev Tools, API or Library

**[IMPACT] Please describe your proposed solution.
Answer:**

Today, the cardano community is growing,so the demand for mining and information retrieval on the blockchain is increasing. There have been some API service providers for the community, but due to the high demand. The current access is quite slow and insufficient. Realizing the importance of this development, we decided to build and develop an API system based on our cardano node and DB synchronization system.

**[IMPACT] How does your proposed solution address the challenge and what benefits will this bring to the Cardano ecosystem?
Answer:**

Our proposed solution allows the connection between the application system and the Cardano blockchain datastore.

**Benefits for the Cardano ecosystem:**

-   Developers can focus on application development without worrying about building node infrastructure to access data because our APIs already provide.
-   Providing APIs for the community to use will give developers more options to interact with the Cardano blockchain
-   Developers and businesses have a comprehensive and customizable toolkit to build their blockchain applications
-   By building APIs we will contribute to expanding the community of Cardano users

**[IMPACT] How do you intend to measure the success of your project?
Answer:**

-   The success of the project will be measured by the number of programmers using the API and the popularity of the community
-   Accept contributions from the community. Not only contributions from queries from the community but also contributions to infrastructure setup, documentation, source code are included. DCOne Crypto will be completely open source. That represents the benefits brought to the Cardano ecosystem.

**[IMPACT] Please describe your plans to share the outputs and results of your project?
Answer:**

**Our plan:**

1.  Finalization of API integration documentation.
2.  Develop products according to expected deadlines
3.  Publish information on website and github
4.  Share information to the community on Telegram groups, Twitter
5.  Receive comments, continue to improve and release new updates

**[CAPABILITY/ FEASIBILITY] What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?
Answer:**

**Our DCOne Crypto team:**

Our total Fund 9 proposal has 02 projects. Funded for 01 catalyst proposal and successfully completed and delivered.

From the project at Fund 9 we have achieved some success & dedication to the community on the Cardano ecosystem. So we continue to believe that these are some of the reasons we are able and fit to continue developing the products we have suggested above.

**[CAPABILITY/ FEASIBILITY] What are the main goals for the project and how will you validate if your approach is feasible?
Answer:**

What are the main goals of the project and how would you validate if your approach is viable?

  

**The main goals for our project:**

-   Building a Cardano data synchronization and node infrastructure system
-   Developed an open source Cardano API system that accesses the block database.
-   Provides precise functionality and scalability
-   Promote popular use and connect communities, app developers, blockchain enterprises, Defi, Dapps....

  

**To confirm the feasibility of our method, we will use the following measures.**

-   Testing and ensuring the API works smoothly with the Cardano blockchain will be essential
-   Based on the user analytics API, we can know the interest of the community, can calculate the load capacity and scalability of the system
-   Our website dconecrypto.finance will also use this API system so we can also evaluate it.
-   Join the Cardano community to promote our products and get user feedback to help us improve our products.

  

In addition, this is an open source project so community updates to the project repository over time will show the feasibility of this goal.

**[RESOURCES & VALUE FOR MONEY] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?
Answer:**

**The cost of the project represent value for the Cardano ecosystem by:**

-   Enhancing developer productivity: Developers can save time and effort by leveraging the pre-built components and functionalities offered by the API system. This increased productivity translates into cost savings for developers and organizations building applications on Cardano.
-   Less burden on developers: By using our APIs, developers can focus on building great features for their apps instead of starting from scratch. This helps application development projects to be completed quickly. Businesses can then take advantage of market opportunities faster, increasing revenue and return on investment.
-   Leverage the existing system: By using our API system, developers can take advantage of Cardano's robust and secure blockchain infrastructure without costly investments or maintenance costs continuously.
-   Drive ecosystem growth and innovation: Our API system is open source, so developers are free to build and contribute together. This helps to expand use cases, engage broader users, and bring more value to the growth of the Cardano ecosystem.

  

These benefits contribute to the overall value and success of Cardano as a blockchain platform.
